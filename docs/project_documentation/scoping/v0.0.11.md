# Project Scoping v0.0.11

*29th May 2023*

- I took a bit of a break from writing. Time to get back into it. Anyways, some interesting stuff has been happening in terms of new Open sourced models. There has been some cool applications of langchain. ~
- In my own langchain work, i half-made a Langchain application that took a URL (in this case it was hacker news) and web scrape the latest titles on the main webpage. I told the LLM to extract the title and the url if it contained any mention of AI/ML/GPT/LLM's etc. The model would then use an agent to iteratively go through the links and produce a summary of the article. I didn't get this far for a few reasons: The SerpAPI, used for searching google, is super expensive. And because i got busy so i didn't have the time.. I will come back to it eventually.

- I also did some introductory tutorials with Langchain. Heres [the PR](https://github.com/tempnamefornow/ar-assistant/pull/3) for that work
- Discovered streamlit, which is a lightweight python library for making dashboards. [https://streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io)
