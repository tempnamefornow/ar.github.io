## Notes

**GPT4ALL 2.0**

- The same makers of GPT4ALL, Nomic.ai, have released a new version of the gpt4all model. This time instead of using the GPL licensed LLaMa model, they used the Apache licence GPT-J model. Meaning it can be used commercially. 
    - [Online dataset visualization](https://atlas.nomic.ai/map/gpt4all_data_clean)
    - [Tech Report](https://static.nomic.ai/gpt4all/2023_GPT4All-J_Technical_Report_2.pdf)
    - [Git Repo](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all)
- They have quantized it down to 4 bits, to all people to run it on their machines. 
- GPT-J is a lot smalled than the original LLaMA model, but they try to compensate for this but applying a much larger dataset. (gpt-j 800K dataset, 400K originally )
- Issues: `"As an AI model, I ..."` is shown a lot in the responses.

**BabyAGI**

- BabyAGI is a novel task-driven autonomous agent that leverages OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 language model, Pinecone vector search, and the LangChain framework to perform a wide range of tasks across diverse domains.
    - [Github Repo](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi)
- Essentially, you give the model a task, then it defines a list of steps to execute and tries to complete those actions autonomously.
- How it works:
    1. It pulls the first task from the task list
    2. It sends that tast to the execution agent (used OpenAI API)
    3. Enriches task and stores in Pinecone
    4. It creates new tasks and reprioritizes the list based on the Objective
