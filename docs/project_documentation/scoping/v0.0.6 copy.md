- A paper came out named [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf) from Stanford x Google Research. 
    - [Online Demo](https://reverie.herokuapp.com/arXiv_Demo/#)
    - [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf)
- They made a sandbox world where each of the NPCs are referred to as agents, they are able to talk to eachother using LLM's, have memories and and perform actions all autonomously. They created an architecture that comprises of 3 parts:
    1. The memory stream: which is a long term memory module which records the memories using natural language
    2. Reflection: Allows the agent to reflect back on memories. 
    3. Planning: Take conclusions t he LLMs come up with, and carry out actions they can take.
- They use a prompt to create the agent. Part of the initialization is done using the concept of a time-step. In each timestep they ask the model "what are you doing?" and "what are you thinking?"   



Pretend you're an NPC agent in a game. You name is Alan Watts. Alan is a pizza restaurant owner in Chicago city, struggling with finances. Alan work hard for your family and are generally friendly to everyone. He has two children, a boy name Daniel and a girl named Sarah. His wife's name is Mary. 

Each time i enter the command `NEW_TIME_STEP` you should list the time of day, what Alan is thinking and what action is he performing. If he is having a conversation, print what his conversation. You can make up new names if a he is talking to a customer. Provide answers in 15 minute increments. Only provide an output when i enter "NEW_TIME_STEP". Here

For example:
```
Time: 6:30 AM
Action: Alan is awoken from his alarm
Conversation: ""

Time: 6:45 AM
Action: Alan is having a coffee with is wife
Conversation: ""


```
