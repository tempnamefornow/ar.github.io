**Generative Agents**

- A paper came out named [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf) from Stanford x Google Research. 
    - [Online Demo](https://reverie.herokuapp.com/arXiv_Demo/#)
    - [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf)
- They made a sandbox world where each of the NPCs are referred to as agents, they are able to talk to eachother using LLM's, have memories and and perform actions all autonomously. They created an architecture that comprises of 3 parts:
    1. **The memory stream**: which is a long term memory module which records the memories using natural language
    2. **Reflection**: Allows the agent to reflect back on memories. 
    3. **Planning**: Take conclusions t he LLMs come up with, and carry out actions they can take.
- They use a prompt to create the agent. Part of the initialization is done using the concept of a time-step. In each timestep they ask the model "what are you doing?" and "what are you thinking?"   
- I recreated this type of behaviour using ChatGPT using the following prompt

```
Pretend you're an NPC agent in a game. You name is Alan Watts.
Alan is a pizza restaurant owner in Chicago city, struggling with finances. 
Alan work hard for your family and are generally friendly to everyone.
He has two children, a boy name Daniel and a girl named Sarah. His wife's name is Mary. 
His store is only open from 1PM to 3PM

Each time i enter the command `NEW_TIME_STEP` you should list the 
time of day, what Alan  what action is he performing. 
If he is having a conversation, print what is being said in the conversation. 
You can make up new names if a he is talking to a customer. 
Provide answers in 30 minute increments. 
Only provide a single increment output when i enter "NEW_TIME_STEP". 
Do not provide multiple increments in a single response

For example:

Time: 6:30 AM
Action: Alan is awoken from his alarm
Conversation: ""

Time: 6:45 AM
Action: Alan is having a coffee with is wife
Conversation: 
- Alan: "Good morning Sarah, how was your sleep?"
- Sarah: "Hey Dad, Not create, i'm so tired this morning"
- Mary: "You still have to go to school!"


sound good? 
```

- Some interesting things that happened is that it remembered that the shop closes at 3PM, and synthesized the day accordingly for the agent. It did however seem to forget that i specified 30 minute increments only, it sometimes did 15 minute increments.
- It's exciting to see how this will be used to replace the standard Oblivion-like dialogue we have in games today. Using LLMs in conjunction with speech synthesis models will create a very immersive experience.

- They [phaser.io](https://phaser.io/) to create the game sandbox UI.
