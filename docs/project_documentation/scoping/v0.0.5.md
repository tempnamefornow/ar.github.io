# Project Scoping v0.0.4

*13st April 2023*



## Notes

- I've been away for a while so its hard to remain caught up on all that has been going on. But to be fair, its hard for even someone who has all the time in the world to remain up to date in whats going on. There has been a groundbreaking releases of the use of LLMs in the passed few weeks. 
- I will list here just some of the main ones that I found:
